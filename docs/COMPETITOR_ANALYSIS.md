## Competitor Pain Points We Can Exploit

### 1. Pricing Transparency
**Pain Point:** Vanta and Drata criticized for lack of pricing transparency, hidden fees, steep renewals.
**Our Advantage:** Publish clear, transparent pricing tiers with no hidden costs.

### 2. Customization Limitations
**Pain Point:** "Vanta needed too much admin lift to customize — not scalable"
**Our Advantage:** Flexible custom controls, organization-specific policies.

### 3. Auditor Friction
**Pain Point:** "Auditors were reluctant to use it... wanted to walk through controls over video chats"
**Our Advantage:** Audit Bundle Export with auditor-friendly format, evidence packaging.

### 4. Multi-Framework Support
**Pain Point:** "SOC 2 is where Vanta shines. For ISO 27001 or HIPAA, the tooling feels less mature"
**Our Advantage:** Equal support for all 6 frameworks with proper control mappings.

### 5. Integration Depth
**Pain Point:** "Limited integration capabilities, particularly for custom applications"
**Our Advantage:** Open integration hub with API-first design.

### 6. Support Quality
**Pain Point:** "Vanta lacked engagement and guidance—left some users managing their SOC audit manually"
**Our Advantage:** AI-powered remediation chat provides 24/7 guidance.
